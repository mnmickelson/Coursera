# Social Media Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and PDF file for a data analysis project focused on analyzing the performance of different categories of social media posts. The project was completed as part of a task to optimize social media strategy for a marketing agency specializing in promoting brands and products on a popular social media platform.

## Project Objectives
- Increase client reach and engagement on social media.
- Gain valuable insights to improve social media performance.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to clients.

## Project Files
- `SocialMediaDataAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete data analysis process.
- `SocialMediaDataAnalysis.pdf`: PDF file generated from the notebook for easy viewing.

## Contents
- **Data Collection**: Utilized the Twitter API to extract tweets from specified categories (fitness, tech, family, beauty, etc.).
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns within each category. Calculated performance metrics and compared them to determine relative effectiveness.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots, word clouds) to represent key findings and trends.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Interpreted the analysis results, provided actionable insights, and made data-driven recommendations to improve social media strategy.
